# Health Insurance Exploratory Data Analysis
### Context
This dataset was retrieved from Codecademy's Medical Insurance Project as describes members of a health insurance plan. I will be performing a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to make better sense of the data.
This EDA will enable me to understand patterns, detect anomalies, and find interesting relationships between the variables present. Once EDA is complete, this dataset can be utilized for more complex analyses.
